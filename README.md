# graph traversal algorithms

Graph traversal is the process of finding some path in a network, or just exploring the network in a particular way.

Depth First Search (DFS) will explore a graph deeply as opposed to widely.

Breadth First Search (BFS) will explore a graph widely as opposed to deeply.
